## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet — Phase 1 starts here._

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Monorepo scaffolding.** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo, three publishable packages (`@gmsim/engine`, `@gmsim/data`, `@gmsim/web`), shared TypeScript config, Prettier + EditorConfig.
- **Engine type system** (`packages/engine/src/types`) covering `LeagueState`, `TeamIdentity`, `TeamState`, `Player`, `Owner`, `Gm`, `HeadCoach`, `Contract`, `TeamPersonality`, plus branded ID types (`TeamId`, `PlayerId`, etc.) and stable string-literal enums for divisions, positions, market sizes, scheme archetypes, franchise histories, and competitive windows.
- **Seeded PRNG** (`packages/engine/src/prng`) — sfc32 algorithm with cyrb128 seed mixing. Supports `next/nextInt/nextRange/pick/shuffle/weighted/gaussian/normal`. Independent forks via `fork(label)` so subsystem changes don't shift random outcomes elsewhere. Serializable for save/load.
- **All 32 NFL teams** (`packages/data/src/team-base/teams.ts`) with conference, division, and market-size classification matching the design doc requirement (8 LARGE / 14 MEDIUM / 10 SMALL).
- **Web app shell** (`apps/web`) — Vite + React 18 + Tailwind. Renders a deterministic PRNG self-check and the league grouped by division as a sanity check that engine + data + UI wiring all resolve.
- **Anchor docs** — `docs/NORTH_STAR.md` (information attribution, hidden complexity, authentic discovery) and `docs/LIVING_LEAGUE.md` (32-team simultaneous simulation, NPC AI requirements, stress-test checkpoints).
- **Design docs index** — `docs/design-docs/README.md` lists all 17 module docs + 2 anchor docs + 2 resolution docs + 4 research docs with their Drive IDs, organized by implementation phase.
- **Test suites.** `@gmsim/engine` has 10 PRNG tests (determinism, fork independence, serialize/deserialize round-trip, statistical weighting, property-based bounds checks via fast-check). `@gmsim/data` has 5 tests asserting team count, conference split, division balance, market-size distribution, abbreviation uniqueness.
- **Versioning workflow** — Conventional Commits convention documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; this changelog; `scripts/sync-versions.mjs` for in-sync bumping across all workspace packages.

### Notes

- No game logic yet. This is scaffolding only — the goal of Phase 0 was to lock the architecture so Phase 1 can implement game systems against stable seams.
- Real NFL team names are used because the project is single-player and internal. If distribution scope ever changes, `packages/data/src/team-base/teams.ts` is the only file affected.
- North Star compliance is enforced at the type level: ground-truth `Player` records are not interchangeable with the (not-yet-built) UI snapshot type. The knowledge layer (`packages/engine/src/knowledge`) is empty but reserved.
